## Dev Notes

Here are some steps I took to generate these API docs in Mintlify.

<Note>
  These still have plenty of configuration to do and figure out. I am not sure why the Interactive Playground is not working.

### Get the OpenAPI json file from SSO

I generated the OpenAPI json file from SSO with:

```
rake oapi:fetch store=sso-api.json
```

I had to add this to the Rakefile:
```
require 'grape-swagger/rake/oapi_tasks'
GrapeSwagger::Rake::OapiTasks.new('API')
```

<Note>
We will want to automate this. We can use a Github action to run this and commit the file to the Documentation repo.

Mintlify also has this which we might can use. [Multirepo Action](https://github.com/mintlify/multirepo-action)
</Note>

### Generate MDX Files in Mintlify

[Mintlify Documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) on generating [MDX](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration)

They [recommend to autogenerate the files](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) based on the OpenAPI json file.

I used the following command to generate the MDX files inside the Documenation repo:

`npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file api-reference/openapi.json -o api-reference/network`

where `api-reference/openapi.json` is the openapi file generated in SSO.

The -o param specifies where to generate the mdx files

#### Generate Navigation Object
The output of that will generate a navigation object. Copy that. That goes in the mint.json file under navigation.



```
npx mintlify-openapi-mdx sso-api.json
```
