## Welcome

The Accountâ€™s API endpoints are split into three groups based on authentication method.

The three groups and their authentication method are:

- [**Network APIs](/api-reference/network):** uses Basic Authentication using the api_key of the account as the password.
- [**Internal APIs**](https://ap.com/api/accounts/internal/endpoints#description/authentication): uses a Machine to Machine token for app to Accounts communication. It also uses browser session based authentication.
- [**UI APIs**:](https://ap.com/api/accounts/ui/endpoints#description/authentication) uses browser session based authentication. These endpoints are used primarily by the Account frontend client. Endpoints relating to [Domains](https://www.notion.so/Domains-1c06b931b4bd4386a8db8acb9f1a6091?pvs=21) are available for TrustedForm and other product apps.

## Authentication

HTTP Basic Authentication is used.

The `username` is ignored, but you must still provide one. You may use 'X' in place of a user name.

The password is the API key of the targeted account.

Here is an example, where `X` is the username and `123456789` is the api key of the account:

```bash cURL
  $ curl -X GET -uX:1234567890 -H 'Accept: application/json' https://account.staging.activeprospect.com/api/network/invitations
```
