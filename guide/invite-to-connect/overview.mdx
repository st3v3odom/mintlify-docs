# Invite To Connect

This document will walk you through the different steps of an example Invite to Connect flow.

## Example Flow

Here is an excerpt from the problem statement in [LeadConduitâ€™s ADR on Invite to Connect](https://github.com/activeprospect/architectural_decision_records/blob/sc-75835/discovery-plan-how-to-handle-the-invite-to/leadconduit/0006-invite-to-connect.md).

> LeadConduit wants to connect seller account sources to their buyer account flows. This is possible using custom sources, but with the new connections feature from the Account's Team, we can connect the actual entity account instead and link submission documents automatically.
> 
> 
> However, there is a problem when the user is not signed up yet. The account entity does not exist at this point, and we don't want to block the buyer from working on their flow, adding mapping templates, pricing, caps, etc.
> 

Here is how the Accountâ€™s side of this can be accomplished using Accountâ€™s API endpoints.

**Send an invite**

We start the Invite to Connect process by sending an invitation to an email address.

```yaml
type: curl
description: Send an invitation to the user
endpoint: https://account.staging.activeprospect.com/api/network/invitations
method: POST
rows: 7
data:
 email: invitee@newcompany.com
 registration_path: leadconduit/seller
 inviter_id: SSOUSERIDOFSENDER
 description: an optional message from the inviter.
auth:
 type: basic
 username: X
 password: YOURACCOUNTAPIKEYHERE

```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ You can edit all the curl command below by clicking on it and typing. Try replacing the password with the API key of a real staging account and click execute. â€˜Xâ€™ can be used as the username for all.

</aside>

Here are details on the parameters to send:

```yaml
type: parameters
filename: networkApiSpec
class: formData
api: /api/network/invitations
method: post

```

Getting the inviter_id can take some effort. It is not exposed in the UI. That user must belong to the account. Maybe we can add an api endpoint to Internal that returns a user given an email address.

The response of the invite creation looks like this:.

```yaml
type: entity
description: The response of the Invite creation
filename: networkApiSpec
entity: Network_ConnectionInvitation
```

**You will want to save the id of the returned invitation.** The LC ADR proposes a field for this.

### Kafka Response

The Accounts app will send a [Kafka message](https://www.notion.so/Topics-6815f889d3de442dbba8b3ebb91dd62a?pvs=21) when the invite is accepted. You can use this saved invitation id to match the Kafka message with your original invitation. [TODO: add a sample response for the `connection_invitation.accepted` entity when itâ€™s implemented.

**Triggering a Kafka Message**

We can programmatically accept an invitation for testing purposes. This is useful in triggering the Kafka message to be sent.

```yaml
type: curl
description: Accept an invitation
endpoint: https://account.staging.activeprospect.com/api/network/invitations/YOURINVITATIONID
method: POST
rows: 3
auth:
 type: basic
 username: X
 password: YOURACCOUNTAPIKEYHERE
```

### Other Useful Curl Commands for Testing

These endpoints below can be helpful to when testing your work.

**Fetching Existing Invitations**

If the invitation was successfully sent, you should see it in this listing of all invitations sent with this request.

```yaml
type: curl
description: Fetch invitations for an account.
instructions: 
endpoint: https://account.staging.activeprospect.com/api/network/invitations/sent
method: GET
auth:
 type: basic
 username: X
 password: YOURACCOUNTAPIKEYHERE
```

The response will return a list of invitation objects. It is shown above but you can also see it at [this permalink location](https://ap.com/api/entities/networkApiSpec/Network_ConnectionInvitationEntity).

**Fetching Existing Connections**

Once the invitation is accepted, you should see the connection in the accountâ€™s list of connections. This request will fetch all existing connections for an account. If an invite has been accepted, you should see the connection in this result.

```yaml
type: curl
description: Check existing connections for an account.
endpoint: https://account.staging.activeprospect.com/api/network/connections
method: GET
auth:
 type: basic
 username: X
 password: YOURACCOUNTAPIKEYHERE

```

The response will return a list of all connections. A connection object looks like this:

```yaml
type: entity
description: An invitation
filename: networkApiSpec
entity: Network_ConnectionInvitation
```

## Notes on Remaining Work

- [ ]  Stop deleting invitations after they've been accepted or declined. Add an enum similar to - InvitationRequest with :pending, :accepted, :declined. We need to link an invitation to a connection. We could also add invitation_id to the connection. That may be better as we would only need to setup a Kafka topic for connections.
- [ ]  Add connection_id to an invitation. This will let LC know which account to use when assigning the source
- [ ]  Ensure that the Network::ConnectionInvitationEntity  exposes this info
